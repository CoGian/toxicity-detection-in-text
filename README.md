# Toxicity detection in text
This work focuses on the development of machine learning models, in particular neural networks, where they can detect toxicity in comments. The topics we will be dealing with: 
- Cost-sensitive learning
- Class imbalance 

Toxicity is defined as anything rude, disrespectful or whatever way possible forces a user to leave a conversation.
