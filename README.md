# toxicity-detection-in-text
This work focuses on the development of machine learning models, in particular neural networks, where they can detect toxicity in comments. The topics we will be dealing with: 
- Cost-sensitive learning
- Class imbalance 

Toxicity is defined as anything rude, disrespectful or whatever way possible forces a user to leave a conversation.
